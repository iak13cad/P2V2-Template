"""
Description:
Write a Python script that repeatedly prompts the user to enter two numbers and then attempts to divide the first number by the second. The program should handle potential errors gracefully and provide useful feedback to the user.

Requirements:

    Continuously prompt the user to input two numbers until the user decides to exit.
    Perform the division operation and display the result.
    Implement exception handling for:
        Division by zero.
        Non-numeric input.
    Allow the user to exit the program by entering a specific keyword (e.g., 'quit').

    Example Interaction and Output
Input 1
Enter the first number or type 'quit' to exit: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Output:
Result: 5.00

Input 2
Enter the first number or type 'quit' to exit: 10
Enter the second number: 0

Output:
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.

Input 3
Enter the first number or type 'quit' to exit: ten
Enter the second number: 2

Output:
Error: Please enter valid numbers.
